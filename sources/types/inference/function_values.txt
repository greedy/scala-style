Function Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function values support a special case of type inference which is worth calling
out on its own::
    
    val ls: List[String] = ...
    ls map { str => str.toInt }
    
In cases where Scala already knows the type of the function value we are declaring,
there is no need to annotate the parameters (in this case, ``str``).  This is an
intensely helpful inference and should be preferred whenever possible.  Note that
implicit conversions which operate on function values will nullify this inference,
forcing the explicit annotation of parameter types.
