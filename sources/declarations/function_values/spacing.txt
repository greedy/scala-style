Spacing
~~~~~~~

You will notice that both (1) and (4) insert spaces after the opening brace and
before the closing brace.  This extra spacing provides a bit of "breathing room"
for the contents of the function and makes it easier to distinguish from the
surrounding code.  There are *no* cases when this spacing should be omitted.
