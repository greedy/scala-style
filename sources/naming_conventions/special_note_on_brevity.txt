Special Note on Brevity
-----------------------

Because of Scala's roots in the functional languages, it is quite normal for
local field names to be extremely brief::
    
    def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
    
While this would be bad practice in languages like Java, it is *good* practice
in Scala.  This convention works because properly-written Scala methods are
quite short, only spanning a single expression and rarely going beyond a few
lines.  Very few local fields are ever used (including parameters), and so there
is no need to contrive long, descriptive names.  This convention substantially
improves the brevity of most Scala sources.

This convention only applies to method parameters and local fields.  Anything
which affects the public interface of a class should be given a fully-descriptive
name.
