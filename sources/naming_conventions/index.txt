Naming Conventions
==================

Generally speaking, Scala uses "camelCase" naming conventions.  That is, each
word (except possibly the first) is delimited by capitalizing its first letter.
Underscores (``_``) are *heavily* discouraged as they have special meaning within
the Scala syntax.  Please note that there are a few important exceptions to this
guideline (as given below).
