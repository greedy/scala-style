Scala Style Guide
=================

In lieu of an official style guide from EPFL, or even an unofficial guide from
a community site like Artima, this document is intended to outline some basic
Scala stylistic guidelines which should be followed with more or less fervency.
Wherever possible, this guide attempts to detail *why* a particular style is
encouraged and how it relates to other alternatives. As with all style guides,
treat this document as a list of rules to be broken. There are certainly times
when alternative styles should be preferred over the ones given here.
