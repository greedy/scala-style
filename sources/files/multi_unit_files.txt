Multi-Unit Files
----------------

Despite what was said above, there are some important situations which warrent the
inclusion of multiple compilation units within a single file.  One common example
is that of a sealed trait and several sub-classes (often emulating the ADT
language feature available in functional languages)::
    
    sealed trait Option[+A]
    
    case class Some[A](a: A) extends Option[A]
    
    case object None extends Option[Nothing]
    
Because of the nature of sealed superclasses (and traits), all subtypes *must*
be included in the same file.  Thus, such a situation definitely qualifies as
an instance where the preference for single-unit files should be ignored.

Another case is when multiple classes logically form a single, cohesive group,
sharing concepts to the point where maintenance is greatly served by containing
them within a single file.  These situations are harder to predict than the
aforementioned sealed supertype exception.  Generally speaking, if it is *easier*
to perform long-term maintenance and development on several units in a single
file rather than spread across multiple, then such an organizational strategy
should be preferred for these classes.  However, keep in mind that when multiple
units are contained within a single file, it is often more difficult to find
specific units when it comes time to make changes.

**All multi-unit files should be given camelCase names with a lower-case first letter.**
This is a very important convention.  It differentiates multi- from single-unit
files, greatly easing the process of finding declarations.  These filenames may
be based upon a significant type which they contain (e.g. ``option.scala`` for
the example above), or may be descriptive of the logical property shared by all
units within (e.g. ``ast.scala``).
